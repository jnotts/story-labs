# Story Labs

Interactive storytelling app with AI narration - initial build in a 2-hour speed-run.

## Project Brief
Create an interactive storytelling platform where users write stories and generate AI narration. Focus on creative writing experience with glassmorphism UI over mountain backgrounds.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 App Router, React, TailwindCSS with custom glassmorphism styling
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui heavily customized for liquid glass aesthetic
- **Future TTS**: ElevenLabs API integration planned for voice narration

## Architecture Choices
- **SSR Authentication**: Supabase SSR with proper middleware for session management across client/server
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Custom CSS variables and floating panels instead of traditional SaaS layouts
